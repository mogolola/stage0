    Jike ZHANG is well known as 'Tiger' in Chinese Pingpang team because of his incredible fast speed and extremely strong urge to attack. He has alaways been considered as one of the most talented Chinese table tennis players. He is the third table tennis player who has won a grand slam, the first man who did this was his coach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Guoliang">Guoliang LIU</a></p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em;">Before the game people were wondering if ZHANG could continue his journey in Rio because of his back injury, now they see him. Lack of just just one golden medal to his second grand slam, many have thought highly on him. Well, competation is crucial. ZHANG is obviously not at his best in the game. He was even fallen asleep on the sofa just 10 mins before his match against the Japanese athlete Koki Niwa and easily beaten in the first set. Head coach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Guoliang">Guoliang LIU</a> was not happy with this so he called a timeout and said to him "wake up boy this is fucking Olympic games!". Well Tiger is tiger, ZHANG came back to win the later 4 sets in a row and never looked back.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em;">Unfortunately ZhANG's back injury has relapsed during his match against Vladimir Samsonov in the semi finale. Smashing the rival though, he had to face off against his teammate:world no1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Long_(table_tennis)">Long MA</a> in the final. Out of everyone's expection he gave up easily in the final and was beaten as 4:0. Many people thought he did this for the honor of the team because he had to prepare well for the upcoming team competiation and could not lose to much energy here. This is kind of a tradition. Many felt pity for him since he has come so far and sent the title away so easily. While ZHANG said"the silver medal is even more good-looking" that kind of explain his behavior. He has no strong desire to win for himself, he fight for the team.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em;">He has got lots of fans after the Olympic games. No doubt he is a real athlete. Lots of people love him for his character. Let's see ZHANG in his fans' eyes
